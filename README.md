Final Project for Summer '19

Project title
A Guide to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter

Motivation
I made this site as a guide for those wanting to go to Harry Potter World who are overwhelmed by it. It's a simple guide highlighting all the best places and rides to try while exploring the huge park.

This project was built using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript on Brackets.
