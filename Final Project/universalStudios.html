        <h1> Shops</h1>
        <p> Inside of Universal Studios, seated within the brick walls, sits Diagon Alley. Once you walk through, the sounds of bricks shuffling behind you, you see the same image Harry first saw upon his entry to the Wizarding World. Just like him, you'll be amazed at all there is to see and do. There's loads of shops here, so I won't be talking about them all, but I will tell you of all of my favorites and my must-stops</p>
        <h2> All Your Favorite Pranking Products From Your Favorite Twins</h2>
        <p> The first place you should stop, espacially because it's right by the entrance of Diagon Alley, is Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. You can't exactly miss it, what with it's giant red haired man standing at the entrance, and the flashing "You know Poo" window. This shop is filled with some of the more notable Weasley twin creations, like extendable ears. Connected to the store is also Quality Quiditich Supplies, which has a lot of quidditch themed clothing and gear. So you get a two in one here.</p>

        <h2> Every Student Needs a Robe</h2>
        <p> Another cool place to stop is Madame Malkin's Robes for All Ocassions. Here, you can get your house themed cloaks and sweaters, among other merchandise. Now don't get me wrong, the sweaters and robes will cost you a pretty penny. But they're really cool if you're someone who really likes to represent their house or dresses up a lot. And the sweaters are some of the most comfortable and warm sweaters I've ever felt. So even if you aren't really feeling like splurging on a cloak, the sweater may be a good investment.</p>
            </div>
        <h2> It's a Creepy Shop for Creepy Blokes</h2>
        <p> Next up, is Borgin and Burke's. That's right, Knockturn Alley lies right next to Diagon Alley, and it wouldn't be complete without this notorious shop. Here, there are loads of clothes with dark marks, Slytherin memorabilia, and other creepy gear and goods. It's a store that would make Malfoy feel at home, that's for sure. </p>
        <h1> Food</h1>
        <p> There aren't a ton of places to eat in Diagon Alley. There are however, two very notable places that you should stop at at least once.</p>
        <h2 class="leak"> The Leaky Cauldron, Anyone?</h2>
        <p> Harry Potter World would not be complete without The Leaking Cauldron. It's the entrance to Diagon Alley, and it makes numerous appearances throughout the series. The menu here is a lot like the Three Broomsticks. It's got traditional English favorites and a selection of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. It also has that rustic English tavern feel to it. Honestly, the Leaky Cauldron and the Three Brooksticks are pretty similar, so you aren't missing a lot if you only go to one.</p>
        <h2> We All Scream For Ice Cream</h2>
        <p> Okay, it probably isn't a great idea to eat a giant ice cream cone right before riding a roller coaster, but I've never been one to make wise choices. And I love ice cream, so you really can't fault me. That's also why I think everyone should stop at Florean Fortescuse's Ice Cream Parlour.They have Butterbeer flavored ice cream! How could you not want Butterbeer flavored ice cream! Even if you for some reason did not want Butterbeer flavored ice cream, they have loads of other choices such as, chocolate chili, apple crumble, lavender and earl gray tea, and tons of other traditional choices. Totally worth a stop. </p>
        <div class="col">
        <h1> Rides</h1>
        <p> There is only one ride on this side of Harry Potter world, but it's a pretty good one, at least in my opinion. Just like with the Forbidden Journey, you get to see a lot of cool stuff in line, so it doesn't seem like that bad of a wait.</p>
        <h2> The Twisting Tunnels of Gringotts</h2>
      
        <p> Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts is the sole Harry Potter ride on this side of the park. It's a 4d ride, so you're in a cart with glasses on the whole time, but the ride does a good job of convincing you that you're weaving down below ground in the tunnels under Gringotts. Your journey starts with Bill Weasley and a Gringotts goblin offering to show you around, but is interupted when Voldemort and Bellatrix appear. That's when your ride really takes off, as you go up and down the tracks, eventually catching a ride on the dragon Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape on, which is also the one seen on the building. </p>
