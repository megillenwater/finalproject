        <h1> Who Am I?</h1>
        <p> Hey there! My name is Morgan. I've been going to Universal Studios and Harry Potter world nearly every year for the past 5 years. I've learned a thing in two in my visits there, and I'm here to bestow my knowledge upon you. Hopefully, this will help you plan your trip and avoid any major disasters or surprises! </p>
        <p> Now I while I wouldn't consider myself a Universal Studios "Expert", I would definitely consider myself a Universal Studios "Enthusiast." However, I am a pretty big Harry Potter nerd. I've been reading it since I knew what reading was and I dressed like Hermione Granger for Halloween way too many times to count. That means the first time I went to Harry Potter world was pretty much an awakening for little teenage me. </p>

        <h2> My First Harry Potter World Trip</h2>
        <div class="col">
            <p>The first time I went to Harry Potter World was December of 2014. I had previously been to Universal, but Harry Potter World wasn't even on the radar then. This was completely new to me. I was amped. I remember I read The Sorcerors Stone on the 13 hour drive there. It was the week before the New Year, so it was super overcast and cloudy. In other words, it was London weather. It was perfect. </p>
            <p> I can not stress enough how quickly I fell in love with this place. I felt like the world had come to life. I was walking the streets of Hogsmeade, up the cobblestone path to Hogwarts. I definitely cried a little, but we'll pretend it was the slight December chill making my eyes water. From this point on, Ib knew I would always feel at home in this place, and I want you to feel like you're at home too. </p>
             <h2> Some Basic Info About Harry Potter World</h2>
        <p> I'm sure you're done hearing about me, so let's get to the fun stuff. There are two parts of Harry Potter World- Hogsmeade Village and Diagon Alley.</p>
            <p>To get between the two, you can take the Hogwarts Express. To do this, you need a park to park pass. So if you plan to go to each part, keep that in mind when getting tickets. Each of the parks has different rides and stores, so while they are similar, they're also completely different. And I highly reccommend you go to both.</p>
