        <h1> Shops</h1>
        <p> Hogsmeade Village is set up to immitate the little wizarding town that sits right outside Hogwarts. This means it has loads of little stores, vendors, and some smaller restaurants. It can be intimidating, but don't worry, I've got ya covered.</p>
        <h2> Honeydukes, the Sweet Shop of Your Dreams</h2> 
        <div class="col"><p> Right inside the entrance to Hogsmeade is an important place to check out for any Harry Potter fan. The iconic Honeydukes Sweet Shop. Just looking at the place is enough to give you a cavity. It's filled wall to wall with the most notable Harry Potter candy, such as chocolate frogs, fizzing Whizbees, licorice wands, and Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. You may want to be careful with that one. Not only that, but it also has displays of pastries and baked goods for anyone to try out.</p>

            </div>
            
        <h2> A Store Full of All Your Wizarding Needs</h2>
        <p> One of the next shops you'll see is the store Dervish and Bangs, another store in the Harry Potter universe. This little shop has a little bit of everything. It's got your house clothing, your accessories, and lots of little trinkets in toys that everyone can enjoy.This is a great place to grab some little souvenirs if you don't want to get held up after a ride. It also has <a href="secrets.html">a little surprise for fans.</a></p>
        
        <h2> The Wand Chooses The Wizard</h2>
        <p> Possibly the most entertaining part of Harry Potter World, besides the rides of course, is that you can get a wand. In both of the parks, there lies Olivander's shop. Each shop has a full experience, where a worker, dressed as a wisened  old witch/wizard, chooses someone from the crowd to try out a few wands. In trying them out, things fly off the shelves and move around the room, much like in the movies. After a couple tries, the participant finds their new wand, signified by the whoosing of air and the glow of light coming from the ceiling.</p>
            </div>
        <p> Now, this is a really cool experience. If you've got kids, it might be a cool opportunity to take them to the full experience, because from what I've seen, they always pick kids. So if you aren't or done have kids, you can probably skip the immersive part and just go into the shop, meaning you skip a very long line to see a kid wave their arms with a wand. </p>
            
        <p> Once in the shop though, you have dozens up dozens of wands to choose from. Have a favorite character? They've got their wand to choose from, no matter how obscure. Everyone's wand is available, from Sirius Black, to Severus Snape, even Cho Chang. Don't have a favorite character (or simply can't choose)? Well, they've still got you covered. You can choose a wand that corresponds to the Celtic calendar. To do that, you'll give a worker your birthday, then they'll find the wand that has the corresponding tree. Whether you get a character wand or not, you have the choice of an interactive wand, meaning you can cast spells across both parks.</p>
        
        <h1> Food</h1>
        
        <div class="col"><img src=FinalProjectPictures/14565121_682516518571846_1361285434881081344_n(1).jpg class="butterbeer">
            <h2 class="broom"> The Three Broomsticks</h2>
        <p> It's the Three Broomsticks, everyone. We don't see it much in the movies, but we come across it a lot in the book as everyone's favorite Hogsmeade stop for food and butterbeer. Trust me, neither book nor movie fans will be disappointed here. The bustling pub is full of rustic decor, including iron chandeliers, a fireplace, and wooden tables and chairs or benches. This is also where you can sit and enjoy a nice butterbeer, or choose from a menu or traditional English food, like fish and chips or your typical everyday food, like chicken fingers. This pub has both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options, so you can choose to drink a warm butterbeer, or a maybe get a nice Hogs Head brew.</p>
        
        <h2> Everyone's Favorite Shady Pub</h2>
        <p> In the novels, The Hog's Head is a really iffy pub run by Dumbledore's estranged brother. It's typically pretty empty, has a rude and weary bartender, and is known to be a little offputting.</p>
        <p> The Hog's Head at Universal, luckily is not like that. Instad, it's an open, quickservice bar next to The Three Broomsticks. It offers some nice snacks for park goers to munch on, and the same drinks as The Three Broomsticks. This makes it a great place to stop if you don't want a sit down meal, or if The Three Broomsticks is just too crowded.</p>

        <h1> Rides</h1>
        <h2> Your Journey Through Hogwarts</h2>
        <p> My favorite, and perhaps the most well known of the Harry Potter themed rides, the Harry Potter and The Forbidden Journey. This ride is indoors, and the line works its way through the Hogwarts castle, making it one of the most interesting lines at the park. You get to go through Gryffindor common room, see talking portraits, and see lots of <a href=secrets.html>little surprises.</a></p>
        <p> During the actual ride, you sit down on in the seat and are belted in. It's the type of ride where your feet dangle down, which makes sense, because you're supposed to be flying through the grounds of Hogwarts. You'll go through the quiditch pitch, the Chamber of Secrets, and Aragog's lair before the ride is through. It's a good ride for most people, as it doesn't really go upside down, and it's indoors so most people should be able to manage it. If you have someone who is a little more cautious though, the next ride may be a better bet.</p>
        <h2> The Hippogriffs Fly</h2>
        <p> Next up is The Flight of the Hippogriffs. This ride has you in a hippogriff headed cart that goes around the simple track. It's a good ride for people afraid of big rides or someone a little younger. It still goes fast, but doesn't have the big drops or upside down turns that some bigger rides have. And the line isn't typically too long.</p>
        <h2> The Newest Addition</h2>
        <p> The newest addition to Harry Potter World is Hagrid's Magical Creature Motorbike ride. I haven't ridden this one yet, but from videos and advertisements of the ride, it's gotta be a big one. It where The Dueling Dragons ride used to be, and considering that was a pretty big coaster, this one should entertain riders. </p>
